# ULA-Managment-2021
The Ukrainian Leadership Academy is a values-based formation platform for personal and social development for young people. The Academy combines a year-long program between school and university for motivated teenagers aged 16-20 and large-scale social projects for society. I was a participant of the academy in 2021. All the activities that we were engaged in there required strict reporting from volunteering to sports activities, including not only the effectiveness but also a personal assessment of the events, so I had an idea to create a convenient bot in the Telegram messenger, which is widespread in Ukraine, which would collect statistics from each student and generate a report on the academy headquarters in different cities. Unfortunately, after the start of the war, priorities changed a lot and it was necessary to engage in more useful activities, so this project was abandoned, but I want to keep it as a keepsake.
